# Sightwords
SightWords game for children utilizing Python SpeechRecognition and the Kivy Framework

I got inspiration for this app during the Covid Pandemic and our stay at home orders with young children.

This is my seond App and loved learning how to use PyAudio and Speechrecognition.  Adding in these Packages tought me a ton about dependencies.

The struggles of home educating were real and learning sightwords was womething that I felt would help.

Python 3.6 was used and a higher level Python release will not work due to PyAudio.

I have since packaged this for Windows with PyInstaller.
