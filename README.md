# Sightwords
SightWords game for children utilizing Python SpeechRecognition and the Kivy Framework

I got inspiration for this app during the Covid Pandemic and our stay at home orders with young children.

PyAudio and Speechrecognition are both required.  

The struggles of home educating during the pandemic are real and learning sightwords was womething that I felt would help.

Python 3.6 was used and a higher level Python release will not work due to PyAudio.

I have since packaged this for Windows with PyInstaller.
